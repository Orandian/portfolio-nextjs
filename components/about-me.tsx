      <p>
        I&apos;m a passionate software engineer with over 4 years of
        experience building user-friendly and scalable web and mobile
        applications. I specialize in frontend development using React, React
        Native, and Vue, and also work with backend technologies like Node.js,
        Laravel, and Spring Boot to create complete end-to-end solutions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Based in Tokyo, I lead both frontend and mobile projectsâ€”crafting
        custom component libraries, collaborating closely with designers, and
        delivering clean, responsive, and pixel-perfect UIs. My experience
        extends to backend development, where I enjoy designing APIs, managing
        databases, and ensuring smooth integration across the stack.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether it&apos;s launching a mobile app, developing a full-stack
        product, or optimizing performance, I&apos;m always excited to solve
        problems and build intuitive digital experiences.
